# ############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

# ## The deck is unlimited in size. 
# ## There are no jokers. 
# ## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
# ## The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
# ## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
# ## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# ## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn?
# ## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn?
# ## The computer is the dealer.
